NEW FEATURES/MODIFICATIONS:
- BUG ALERT ! Search for: "BUG ALERT 4 ! ". Bug alerts 4 & 5 are from same case, which is, case 2 of 4.
- BUG ALERT ! Search for: "BUG ALERT 5 ! ".

- BUG ALERT ! Search for: "BUG ALERT 3 ! ".

- Declared shell color variables - reset, red, black - as global (is it really global ?) for that class.
Also, remember that - when you are declaring these variables as global (is it really global ?), the brackets used are curly {} and not the usual round () you would use when you are declaring them inside a function.

- Modified level_order() to visualize tree in an ordered space.

- Removed redundant lines of code in print_tree() in the "if" case of root node, had redundant "else" case for red color. Redundancy here is the illogical "if" and "else" cases checking for color for root node since once the node is detected as root, then it has to be black in color.

- BUG ALERT ! Search for: "BUG ALERT 2 ! ".

- BUG ALERT ! Search for: "BUG ALERT 1 ! ".

- Revolutionizing visualization of tree.
	- Checked for BASH shell text-wrap limitations on the generated html file [NO ISSUES FOUND].

- Finalizing display of the entire tree:
	- Found whether a given node to be printed has a sibling or not (so that you need not print spaces).

- Removed unnecessary variable "int level" at the start of public: of class nri_tree.
- Now, root node starts from level 0, not level 1.

- Added Linux BASH shell colors to reflect red and black on Linux BASH shell.

- Commented out unwanted stuff, like vectors and its related function.

- Level-order printing of tree.

- Delete cases implemented !

- Restructuring for the rest of the 3 out of 4 cases done. Question is, do I need to implement recursion here?

- Restructuring completed case 2 of 4 !

- Modify inert_node function to assign the appropriate colors to root and leaf nodes.

- Just a little bit of modifications. No new features introduced in v3.

- Commented unwanted DEBUG print statements.

- Renamed delete_node() to remove_node().

- Delete function for node with two children implemented.

- Delete function for node with no children (leaf node) and node with only one child implemented.

- Checked for duplicate insertions.

WORKING REQUIREMENTS:
- print_tree() function has to be executed at the end of all initial inserts in order to set the levels of nodes.

BUGs:
- Mistake in a comment "(LET'S SAY I PICK THIS ONE IN THIS CODE !)" in remove_node(). You actually picked "2) Pick the largest node from left/less than subtree." but mentioned in the comment as having picked 1).

- Fixed code-not-entering-restructuring case.

- Fixed delete node with only one child issue.

NOTES:

Source: http://algoviz.org/OpenDSA/Books/OpenDSA/html/BinaryTreeTraversal.html#

There are three ways of tree traversal:
1) Preorder : Parent -> Children
2) Postorder: Children -> Parent
3) Inorder	: Left/Less than Children -> Parent -> Right/Greater than Children. (Basically, ascending order).


1) We might wish to make sure that we visit any given node before we visit its children. This is called a preorder traversal.

2) We might wish to visit each node only after we visit its children (and their subtrees). For example, this would be necessary if we wish to return all nodes in the tree to free store. We would like to delete the children of a node before deleting the node itself. But to do that requires that the children's children be deleted first, and so on. This is called a postorder traversal.

3) An inorder traversal first visits the left child (including its entire subtree), then visits the node, and finally visits the right child (including its entire subtree). The Red Black Tree makes use of this traversal to print all nodes in "ascending order" of value.

		If you wanted smallest from lt tree, then its easy, because you are trying to find the node with minimum value in a Red Black Tree. To do that, just traverse the node from root to left recursively until left is NULL. The node whose left is NULL is the node with minimum value.

		However, if you want the largest from lt subtree, then?
		My algorithm:
		From root, traverse lt tree and immediately after passing the root node, traverse only on the gt recursively/iteratively (I've used iteration) until gt node is NULL.
